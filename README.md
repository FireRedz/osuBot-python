The backbone of my irc bot

also the update will stop now, since this is the _backbone_ of my bot and not the bot itself



## How to create a config for the bot
* Create a file named ``conf.py`` in main directory
* then copy these

```
class config:
    ircName = '<IRCUSERNAME>'
    ircPass = '<IRCPASSWORD>'
    apiKey = '<osu!APIKEY>'
```
